# Epic 1: Document Management & Processing

## Epic Overview

**Epic Goal:** Implement a complete document management and processing system that enables users to upload, validate, and process documents through text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation for semantic search.

**Business Value:** Provides the foundation for the RAG system by creating a robust document processing pipeline that converts various file formats into searchable embeddings.

**Dependencies:** None (foundational epic)

## Scope

**Workflow 1: Document Management & Processing**
- Document upload and validation
- File type processing (Excel, PDF, DOCX, JSON)
- Content extraction and chunking
- Embedding generation and storage

## API Endpoints

**Document Management Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/v1/documents/upload
GET /api/v1/documents
DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}
POST /api/v1/documents/process
```

## Technical Requirements

### Supported File Types
- Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word Documents (.docx, .doc)
- JSON (.json)

### Processing Capabilities
- Content extraction from various file formats
- Text chunking and preprocessing
- Integration with external APIs for document import

### Database System
- **Primary Database:** Qdrant Vector Database
- **Purpose:** Store document embeddings and enable semantic search
- **Configuration:** Optimized for 8GB RAM deployment environment

### Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 2 seconds for standard document operations
- Document processing: Batch processing capability
- Memory usage optimized for 8GB RAM environment
- Efficient storage utilization within 50GB limit

## Stories

### 1.1 Basic Document Upload and Validation
**As a** user  
**I want** to upload documents through a secure API endpoint  
**So that** I can store my documents for processing and search

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can upload files via POST /api/v1/documents/upload
- System validates file types (Excel, PDF, DOCX, JSON)
- System validates file size limits (within 50GB storage constraint)
- System returns appropriate error messages for invalid uploads
- System stores document metadata in database
- Upload requires authentication

### 1.2 Document Listing and Management
**As a** user  
**I want** to view and manage my uploaded documents  
**So that** I can track document processing status and organize my content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can retrieve document list via GET /api/v1/documents
- System returns document metadata (filename, size, type, status, upload date)
- System supports pagination for large document lists
- Users can delete documents via DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}
- System ensures users can only access their own documents

### 1.3 PDF Document Processing
**As a** user  
**I want** PDF documents to be processed for text extraction  
**So that** I can search through PDF content using the RAG system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System extracts text content from PDF files
- System handles various PDF formats (text-based, mixed content)
- System chunks extracted text into processable segments
- System generates embeddings from text chunks
- System stores embeddings in Qdrant vector database
- Processing status is trackable via API

### 1.4 Excel Document Processing  
**As a** user  
**I want** Excel documents to be processed for content extraction  
**So that** I can search through spreadsheet data using the RAG system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System extracts text and data from Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- System preserves structured data relationships (tables, columns)
- System extracts product information when available
- System chunks data into searchable segments
- System generates embeddings and stores in vector database

### 1.5 DOCX Document Processing
**As a** user  
**I want** Word documents to be processed for text extraction  
**So that** I can search through document content using the RAG system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System extracts text content from DOCX files
- System preserves document structure (headers, paragraphs, tables)
- System handles complex formatting gracefully
- System chunks text content appropriately
- System generates embeddings and stores in vector database

### 1.6 JSON Document Processing
**As a** user  
**I want** JSON documents to be processed for structured data extraction  
**So that** I can search through structured data using the RAG system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System parses JSON structure and extracts meaningful content
- System handles nested JSON objects and arrays
- System extracts product information from structured data
- System creates searchable text representations
- System generates embeddings from structured content

### 1.7 Asynchronous Processing Pipeline
**As a** user  
**I want** document processing to happen asynchronously  
**So that** I can upload large files without blocking the interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Document processing happens in background workers
- System provides processing status updates
- Users can trigger manual processing via POST /api/v1/documents/process
- System handles processing failures gracefully
- System provides progress indicators for long-running processes

### 1.8 Embedding Generation and Storage
**As a** user  
**I want** document content to be converted into searchable embeddings  
**So that** I can perform semantic search across my documents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System integrates with embedding providers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- System generates embeddings for all processed text chunks
- System stores embeddings in Qdrant vector database
- System maintains metadata linking embeddings to source documents
- System supports multiple embedding models
- System provides fallback options if primary embedding service fails

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Document upload success rate > 95%
- Processing completion rate > 90%
- Average processing time < 5 minutes per document
- Vector storage efficiency within 50GB limit
