# Story 1.1: Basic Document Upload and Validation

## Story Overview

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Document Management & Processing  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Story Type:** Foundation Story (BMad v4+)  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Done  

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want** to upload documents through a secure API endpoint  
**So that** I can store my documents for processing and search

## Context

This is the foundational story for the entire RAG Bot Backend System's document management workflow. All subsequent document processing features (1.2 through 1.8) depend on this basic upload functionality. This story implements the core POST /api/v1/documents/upload endpoint as specified in the PRD and establishes the foundation for the document processing pipeline.

### Business Context
- Provides the entry point for users to interact with the RAG system
- Establishes document validation and security measures
- Creates the basis for asynchronous document processing workflow
- Enables metadata tracking for document management

### Technical Context
- First implementation of authentication-required endpoints
- Establishes file validation patterns for supported types
- Creates document entity management in PostgreSQL
- Sets up integration points for future processing workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Upload Functionality
**AC 1.1.1:** Users can upload files via POST /api/v1/documents/upload endpoint
- Endpoint accepts multipart/form-data requests with `file` field
- Supports file upload through standard HTTP file upload mechanism
- Returns document metadata upon successful upload
- Request requires valid JWT Bearer token authentication

**AC 1.1.2:** System validates supported file types from PRD specification
- Accepts: `.xlsx`, `.xls` (Excel), `.pdf` (PDF), `.docx`, `.doc` (Word), `.json` (JSON)
- Rejects unsupported file extensions with clear error message
- Validation occurs before file processing or storage
- File type detection uses both extension and MIME type validation

**AC 1.1.3:** System enforces file size limits within storage constraints
- Maximum file size: 50MB per file (aligned with 50GB total storage constraint)
- Rejects oversized files with HTTP 413 status and descriptive error
- File size validation occurs before temporary storage
- System tracks total storage usage across all users

### Database Integration
**AC 1.1.4:** System creates document record in PostgreSQL with proper metadata
- Document entity created with: id (UUID), user_id, filename, file_type, file_size, file_path, status
- Initial status set to "uploaded" upon successful storage
- Timestamps (created_at) recorded in UTC
- Foreign key relationship established with authenticated user

**AC 1.1.5:** System stores uploaded files securely in designated location
- Files stored in configured upload directory with generated UUID filenames
- Original filename preserved in database metadata
- File path stored relationally for future processing access
- Storage location configurable through system configuration

### Security and Authentication
**AC 1.1.6:** All upload requests require valid JWT authentication
- Endpoint protected by authentication middleware
- Invalid or missing tokens return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- User context extracted from valid JWT for document ownership
- Expired tokens handled with appropriate error messaging

**AC 1.1.7:** Users can only access their own uploaded documents
- Document ownership enforced through user_id foreign key
- User isolation prevents cross-user document access
- Admin users have enhanced access (future consideration)

### Error Handling and Validation
**AC 1.1.8:** System provides clear error messages for all validation failures
- Invalid file type: "Unsupported file type. Supported formats: .xlsx, .xls, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .json"
- File too large: "File size exceeds maximum limit of 50MB"
- Missing file: "File upload required"
- Authentication errors: "Authentication required" or "Invalid token"

**AC 1.1.9:** System handles edge cases gracefully
- Empty files (0 bytes) rejected with appropriate error
- Duplicate filenames handled with timestamp or UUID suffixes
- Network interruptions during upload handled with timeout
- Concurrent uploads from same user processed independently

### API Response Format
**AC 1.1.10:** Successful uploads return structured JSON response
```json
{
  "document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "uploaded",
  "message": "Document uploaded successfully and queued for processing",
  "filename": "product_catalog.xlsx",
  "file_size": 1048576,
  "file_type": "excel",
  "created_at": "2025-01-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**AC 1.1.11:** Error responses follow consistent error format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_FILE_TYPE",
    "message": "Unsupported file type. Supported formats: .xlsx, .xls, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .json",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-26T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoint Details
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/documents/upload`  
**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`  
**Authentication:** Required (JWT Bearer token)  

**Request Parameters:**
- `file` (required): Binary file data
- `embedding_model` (optional): Preferred embedding model for processing

**Response Status Codes:**
- `201 Created`: Document uploaded successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid file type, size, or missing file
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication
- `413 Payload Too Large`: File exceeds size limit
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side processing error

### Database Schema Requirements

**Document Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN ('excel', 'pdf', 'docx', 'json')),
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'uploaded' CHECK (status IN ('uploaded', 'processing', 'processed', 'failed')),
    chunk_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    embedding_model VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    error_message TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_documents_user_id ON documents(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_status ON documents(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_created_at ON documents(created_at);
```

### File Storage Configuration
- **Local Storage Path:** `./uploads/documents/`
- **File Naming:** `{uuid}.{original_extension}`
- **Directory Structure:** Year/Month partitioning for organization
- **Permissions:** Restrict to application user only

### Architecture Integration Points

**Authentication Service Integration:**
- JWT validation through existing auth middleware
- User context extraction for document ownership
- Role-based access preparation for admin features

**File Processing Queue Integration:**
- Document ready for queueing after successful upload
- Status tracking through database updates
- Integration point for background processing workers

**Configuration Service Integration:**
- File size limits configurable through system settings
- Upload directory path configurable
- Supported file types extensible through configuration

## Business Rules

**BR 1.1.1:** Document Ownership
- Documents belong to the user who uploaded them
- User ID association cannot be changed after upload
- Document access limited to owner (and admins in future)

**BR 1.1.2:** File Validation Priority
- File type validation before size validation
- Size validation before storage
- Authentication validation before any processing

**BR 1.1.3:** Storage Management
- Files stored with UUID names to prevent conflicts
- Original filenames preserved in database for user experience
- Storage directory must exist and be writable

**BR 1.1.4:** Status Management
- All uploaded files start with "uploaded" status
- Status progression: uploaded → processing → processed/failed
- Status changes handled by background processing (future stories)

## Integration Requirements

### Required Services
