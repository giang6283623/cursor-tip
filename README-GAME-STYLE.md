### 🚀 SETTING UP THE MEMORY BANKING SYSTEM

For detailed setup instructions, see: [`memory-banking/guide.md`](memory-banking/guide.md)

**Step 1: Install the Complete Memory Banking Implementation**

```bash
# Navigate to your project root (the sacred ground)
cd your-project-directory

# Copy the isolation_rules folder to .cursor/rules (the ritual of power)
cp -r memory-banking/isolation_rules .cursor/rules/

# Follow the detailed setup guides in setup-custom-mode/
# Each mode has its own setup directory with screenshots and instructions:

```bash
# Create Memory Bank files
touch tasks.md
touch projectbrief.md
touch activeContext.md
touch progress.md
touch implementation-plan.md
```

**Step 3: Activate the 5-Mode System**

In Cursor, use these sacred commands to activate each mode:

```
VAN         # Verification, Analysis, Navigation (Entry point)
PLAN        # Strategic Planning Mode
CREATIVE    # Design & Architecture Mode
IMPLEMENT   # Development Execution Mode
QA          # Quality Assurance & Reflection+Archive Mode

claude
```

**⚡ Ultimate Money-Saving Workflow:**

```javascript
// The Sacred Frugal Development Incantation
const frugalWorkflow = {
  planning: "Use Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (FREE) for architecture and planning",
  implementation: "Use Claude Code extension for targeted code implementation",
  context: "Reference planning files with @ tags for efficient context",
  savings: "Save $240/year by avoiding Cursor Pro+ subscription",
  result: "Professional AI-enhanced development without breaking the budget",
};
```

**💸 Ultimate Cost Benefits:**

## 💀 ENHANCED DEVELOPER'S GRAVEYARD

### _Learn from the Fallen Warriors (Updated with AI Collaboration Wisdom)_

<details>
<summary>⚰️ Classic Deaths & New AI-Era Failures</summary>

**💀 Death by Semicolon**

```
Cause: Inconsistent semicolon usage in Mermaid charts
Solution: Pick a style and stick to it
Resurrection: Use the Chart-mancer's color palette
```

**💀 Death by Scope Creep**

```
Cause: Adding features without planning
Solution: Use the Planning Template religiously
Resurrection: Apply the Protocol Overlord's wisdom
```

**💀 Death by Context Overload**

```
Cause: Trying to work with AI without proper context management
Solution: Master MCP context synthesis techniques
Resurrection: Learn from the MCP Mystic's teachings
```

**💀 Death by AI Dependency**

```
Cause: Relying on AI without understanding the fundamentals
Solution: Master the core skills first, then enhance with AI
Resurrection: Complete the core campaign before advanced MCP
```

**💀 Death by Template Rigidity**

```
Cause: Following the template too literally without adaptation
Solution: Study the live recordings to see template flexibility
Resurrection: Learn template adaptation from the Training Grounds
```

**💀 Death by Planning Paralysis**

```
Cause: Over-planning without executing
Solution: Use the template but start executing phases
Resurrection: Follow the training ground mission examples
```

**💀 Death by Poor AI Collaboration**

```
Cause: Treating AI as a magic solution instead of a partner
Solution: Learn systematic AI collaboration from live recordings
Resurrection: Master the human creativity + AI systematic thinking balance
```

**💀 Death by Memory Banking Chaos**

```
Cause: Skipping modes or not following the Memory Banking workflow
Solution: Master all six modes systematically (VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT → ARCHIVE)
Resurrection: Achieve the ultimate synthesis through the Memory Bank Master quest
```

**💀 Death by Mode Confusion**

```
Cause: Using the wrong mode for the current phase or task
Solution: Understand the purpose and timing of each sacred mode
Resurrection: Study the Chamber descriptions and master each trial
```
